              Thank you for visiting. My intention for this page is for it to
              be, first and foremost, a "cool" place to hang-out. I figured that
              "the business at hand" aspect of synthesizing and presenting the
              information in a clear and professional manner would automatically
              find its own prominence. Especially since this page's reason for
              being is to aid me in obtaining employment, that presentation is
              not likely to be neglected.

              Possibly a novel mental discipline, nonetheless I feel that it has
              been useful in preventing my mindset from becoming too serious.
              Over-seriousness has typically had a muting effect on my
              creativity.

              I've been an artist all my life. In fact I often joke that, at
              heart, I'm still a just five year old who loves drawing dinosaurs.
              Add to that the fact that I am totally a computer nerd and it
              would seem that web development may be an ideal career choice for
              me.

              I love the internet. More specifically, I <em>really</em> love
              when I've finished working on a page, upload it and there it is on
              the small screen, in all its glory. Perhaps after trouble shooting
              a bug for twenty minutes and, at long last, getting to the bottom
              of the problem. Which is gratifying in itself.
            </p>
            <p class="space-after-12px">
              The internet was not yet a thing while I was growing up. If you
              were a designer and your work showed up on the screen it meant it
              was being broadcast on television, which was a pretty big deal. I
              think those connotations must have transferred over to seeing my
              work published on the internet. In any case, I do get juice from
              it.

              My Journey to Becoming a Web Developer

              I suppose my journey to web development began the first time I
              ever saw a 24-bit monitor. Prior to the advent of 24-bit displays,
              computer monitors were limited to 8-bit displays. The evolution of
              monitors from 8-bit displays to 24-bit increased the available
              color palette from 256 to 16,777,216!
            </p>
            <p class="space-after-12px">
              This was a quantum leap forward in fidelity. It allowed for fully
              continuous tone images to be created and displayed. No more blocky
              color transitions. Anti-aliasing was now possible, eliminating
              jagged lines drawn on a diagonal. I was sold then and there. I
              knew that I wanted to pursue a career in computer graphics.
            </p>
            <p class="last">
              I eventually decided to move into web-development as this field
              benefits from both my left brain and right brain aptitudes. I took
              advantage of Amazon's Career Choice program which pays for courses
              at approved schools. I enrolled in a web development boot camp and
              feel good in taking a huge step on my journey.
